# Business Requirements

The Mars Lander Simulator is launched in the belief that by providing
a convenient simulator for CodinGame participants we may witness the rise of
algorithm quality behind Mars Lander problem.

As developers of this simulator we invest heavily in a proper development style
we chose for this project. We expect ourselves to pay lots of attention to
requirements, architecture, design, code construction, and continuous delivery.
We hope for a suitable return on this investment in a form of experience and
better understanding of the development tactics applicable to software projects.

## Background <a name="background"></a>

### Context
As a group of developers spending our free time on CodinGame we did not find
an easy way to train neural network in Mars Lander problem. We decided to
build a tool that will allow us to do that.

### History
#### May, 2017
We tried to solve Mars Lander problem at the end of the evening after a good
bunch of drinks. We advanced to the second level where we were stuck with
landing strategy.
#### June, 2017
We proceeded to the third level. Simple tactics did not work there. The map on
third level is quite complex and requires the lander to find a path to the
landing zone. Implementing A* path finding by converting whole area to a graph
did not appeal to us. We googled possible solutions with Bezier curves and
after a discussion we found out that we are unable to come up with a beautiful
solution. We decided to apply neural network + genetic algorithm tactics.
However, running each generation inside the browser to test its fitness could
not be done.
