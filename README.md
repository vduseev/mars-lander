## What is This?

That's a full copy of [Mars Lander game from CodinGame](codingame.com/training/expert/mars-lander-episode-3), but designed for the purpose of neural network training.
When using the CodinGame website it is impossible to test each epoch of your
network manually. The only solution is to simulate the Mars Lander game locally
somehow, which is exactly what we did.

Besides, you can't debug your code on CodinGame, and you can't draw some helpful
shapes in the visualization to help yourself.

In order to test the idea of neural networks applied to the Mars Lander problem
we created this simulator with a hope that it will aid others implement much
more complex approaches, using debugging of their own IDE and powerful
visualizations of our system.

## Try It Yourself!
You can try it out in two ways: by either downloading the binaries for your
system or by building the project from source. Don't hesitate about the latter
-- we try hard to make this project buildable in one step on most popular
platforms.

### Download Binaries
Get the binaries for your system.

| Platform | Binaries |
|----------|----------|
| Ubuntu 16.04 | |
| Ubuntu 17.04 | |
| Windows 10 x64 | |
| MacOS X 10.5 | |

#### Ubuntu 17.04
Unpack the archive. Note that `##` stands for project version.
```
tar xf mars-lander-x86-64-##.tar
```

#### Windows 10

#### MacOS X

#### Other systems
For any other system closely related to the ones above the project should be
buildable with some tweaks. Though we do not guarantee it.

### Build From Source

#### Get the source code
Clone the repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:vduseev/mars-lander.git
```

or download it https://github.com/vduseev/mars-lander/archive/master.zip.

#### Build it
Get into the root directory of the project.
```
cd mars-lander
```

Run the build script.
```
./build
```
