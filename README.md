## What is This?

CodinGame Mars Lander simulation for neural network training.

## What Problems Does It Solve?
* Running thousands of Mars Lander simulations quickly
* Draw additional things during visualization (bounding boxes, lines, etc.)
* Integration between IDE and CodinGame (no copy-pasting between IDE and broswer)

## How It Works?

## Demonstration
Sorry, no videos yet.

## Documentation
* [Requirements](/documentation/requirements)
